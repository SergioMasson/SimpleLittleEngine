# Simple Little Engine
This project has started as a game for the  olc codejam 2020. However, I found it very interesting to work on a game engine and to learn directX 11. So i decided to make keep working on this project as a way to learn DirectX as well as game development.  

# Build from source
In order to build this project it is required to link against Nvidia physx sdk. The simpler way to do that is to use Vckpg (https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2019) and install the x64 version of the SDK in your machine. After that the project can simply be compiled using visual studio 2019.
